# pdf rendering chromium versus pdftoppm

i want to render PDF vector graphics to high quality raster graphics

for this job im using pdftoppm, but surprisingly,
it creates a slightly different result than the chromium pdf renderer:

with pdftoppm, fine black lines are darker, so overall, the graphic looks darker
